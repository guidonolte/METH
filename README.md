# METH
METH (MEG and EEG Toolbox of Hamburg) is a collection of MATLAB functions to conduct data analysis of MEG and EEG data. 
The main features are 

•	EEG and MEG forward calculation in realistic volume conductors based on expansions of the lead fields in spherical harmonics. 

•	Inverse Calculations: Dipole fitting for ERFs/ERPs and cross-spectra, MUSIC, RAP-MUSIC, SC-MUSIC, minimum norm source reconstruction, eLoreta, and beamformers.

•	Power and coupling measures: cross-spectra coherency, cross-bispectra and bicoherence,1:1  phase locking, power correlation including corrections for artifacts of volume conduction, lagged coherence, phase lag index, multivariate coupling measures robust to artifacts of volume conduction (MIM, MIC, GIM), and wedge music. 

•	Decomposition: MOCA for two or more source distributions

•	Statistics: false discovery rate and permutation test

•	Visualization: topo-plots,  head-in-head plots and time-frequency plots (all in sensor space), MRIs including results in source space, surface plots (e.g. cortex) including results on these surfaces.
